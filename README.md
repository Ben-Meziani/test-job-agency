# test-job-agency

Hi there !

This project is small application in Symfony about a temporary employment agency.
If you want datas, run this command symfony bin/console d:f:l because used fixtures.
If you want to run the assets like JS, Jquery or CSS, you have to run Yarn server or Npm server because I used Webpack-Encore
